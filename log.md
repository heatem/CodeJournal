- Hacking with Swift:
    - Revisited 100 Days of SwiftUI day 16
    - Test Yourself: Complex types
- Parallel work on a potential reading tracking app 

2/23/2025
I'm back! After a couple of years of React Native and some React work, I'm brushing up on SwiftUI. To get started, I'm looking at Day 15 of Hacking With Swift's 100 Days of SwiftUI. It's a review: Learn essential Swift in one hour. https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/242/learn-essential-swift-in-one-hour
- Resolved GitHub issues from this old project
- Hacking With Swift Test Yourself: Simple types https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review#start

Need to finish:
- challenge day 34 (when correct button is tapped, the other 2 should fade to 25%. apply an animation for when wrong button is tapped)
- Day 35 (created project but still need to do almost all of the work)
- Finish day 38: Add some validation to the Save button in AddView. If you enter “fish” or another thing that can’t be converted to an integer, show an alert telling users what the problem is.
