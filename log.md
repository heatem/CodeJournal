- I looked at an article about GitHub Actions because I am missing a 757ColorCoded meetup that covered it. After reviewing some freeCodeCamp resources, I decided I do not need to pursue the $99 certification. It was helpful to read through the explanation and look at my current Actions set up for hmason.dev. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-use-github-actions-step-by-step-guide/

        - Refined settings screen, started game screen
        - Regarding the questions: I created a struct for the questions and decided to generate them all at the start of the game. I have my settings screen down. I want to navigate to a second view for the game. But I also want to look at day 36
    - Started day 36

- Hacking with Swift: 100 Days of SwiftUI - Day 35
    - The challenge for today is to build an edutainment game that tests multiplication skills. It needs to have the following elements:
        - An option for the number(s) to use - For this, I'm thinking buttons for the numbers 1-12. Tapping the button adds the number to an array of numbers to use. I'm using 1-12 because that was standard when I was in school but further refinements could include additional numbers
        - An option for the number of questions - I think a stepper for this
        - A button to start the game
        - A label that displays the question
        - A textfield to enter the answer
        - A label for the score
        - Some way to restart the game at the end
    - Initial considerations:
        - How to generate and maybe store questions? I like the idea of showing the user the questions they got right/wrong at the so they know where to practice more. I could store an array of questions before the game starts, or generate them as we go. For now I may just generate the question in place and change the score as the MVP.
        - I like the idea of buttons for the numbers to test so the user can pick 1 or more options. Cons: This might be unweildy and it limits the options. In the future, I'd add an option to manually enter other numbers.
        - For the number of questions, I'll use a stepper starting at 10, stepping by 1.
        - I want the settings screen to be a separate view so the game screen is as clean and focused as possible.
        - The game screen should have a clearly visible question.
        - For the answer, I'll use textfield with the number pad. Alternately, I could use buttons to make it multiple choice but I will implement the number pad first to reduce the chance of lucky guesses, incorporate another element for my practice, and to see if I'm happy with how that looks.
        - What feedback should I give when the user gets an answer correct? The score will change at the very least, but I should incorporate animations

I'm back! After a couple of years of React Native and some React work, I'm brushing up on SwiftUI. To get started, I'm looking at Day 15 of Hacking With Swift's 100 Days of SwiftUI. It's a review: Learn essential Swift in one hour. https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/242/learn-essential-swift-in-one-hour
- Resolved GitHub issues from this old project
- Hacking With Swift Test Yourself: Simple types https://www.hackingwithswift.com/review#start

Need to finish:
- challenge day 34 (when correct button is tapped, the other 2 should fade to 25%. apply an animation for when wrong button is tapped)
- Day 35 (created project but still need to do almost all of the work)
- Finish day 38: Add some validation to the Save button in AddView. If you enter “fish” or another thing that can’t be converted to an integer, show an alert telling users what the problem is.
